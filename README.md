# TinySol
TinySol is a subset of Solidity, designed to be compatible with Brainfuck, a Turing-complete language with a minimalist instruction set. This project includes a compiler that translates TinySol code into Brainfuck, allowing for the execution of smart contracts and other logic within the Brainfuck environment, suitable for execution on TinyChain.

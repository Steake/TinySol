# 🕶️TinySol: The Brainfuck Red Pill 🕶️

Welcome to the dark side, based autist. If you're tired of normie languages and ready for a real challenge, you've hit the end of the road.

🚀 Say hello to **TinySol** - your based and redpilled ticket to Brainfuck, and the ultimate street cred.

## Why TinySol? 🧐

- **Brainfuck Is Hard**: For those who think ethereum's EVM is not based enough, and programming is too mainstream.
- **Totally Unforgiving**: Just like all good computer programming paradigms, TinySol takes no prisoners.
- **Red Pill Reality**: Ditch the blue pill of conventional smart contracts. Embrace the hypermatrix of Brainfuck via TinySol.

## Into the Abyss 🕳️

Brainfuck is more than just some historical footnote of programming obscurity. It's time to flex true big brained thinking and show the world that you can not only get why Brainfuck is beautiful but also master it with the help of TinySol to rewrite the whole of defi in Brainfuck, an obviously vital step in Blockchain development.

- **Talk the Talk**:Sometimes just because you can, means you must!.
- **Based BFEVM**: You’re not just another scrypt kiddie copypasting Solidity code into Remix right? 🤪 
- **Redfeine money n shit**: So, you should not happy until we rebuild the entire of EVM defi in brainfuck.

## Before Undertaking 🧙

TinySol isn't just about writing code; it's about embracing the chaos of the unknown and wheilding it. Prepare for an experience with as much helpful advice as 4chan, plus a healthy dose of painfully hard to debug issues, which are of course very hard to imagine given the granular nature of brainfuck.

Nevertheless, unless you aren't capable you're dutybound. Our journey to rewriting defi in Brainfuck starts now.

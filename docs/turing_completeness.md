# Turing Completeness in TinySol to Brainfuck Compiler

## Overview
Turing completeness is a fundamental concept in computational theory, describing a system's ability to perform any computational task given sufficient time and memory.

## Turing Machine Characteristics
A computational system is considered Turing complete if it can:
1. Perform arbitrary computations
2. Simulate a Turing machine
3. Support unbounded memory
4. Enable conditional branching
5. Support looping and iteration

## Testing Approach
Our Turing completeness tests verify these characteristics through:
- Universal computation simulation
- Complex memory manipulation
- Algorithmic complexity scenarios
- Conditional branching tests
- Recursive-like behavior simulation

## Test Scenarios
